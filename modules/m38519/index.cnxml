        <title>What Is Traditional Knowledge?</title>
        <para id="id1165762534339">Though difficult to define, <emphasis>traditional knowledge (TK)</emphasis> is generally understood to encompass four types of creative works: <emphasis>verbal expressions </emphasis>(stories, epics, legends, folk tales, poetry, riddles, etc.), <emphasis>musical expressions </emphasis>(folk songs and instrumental music), <emphasis>expressions by action </emphasis>(dances, plays, ceremonies, rituals and other performances) and <emphasis>tangible </emphasis>expressions that must be fixed on a permanent material (drawings, designs, paintings (including body-paintings), carvings, sculptures, pottery, mosaics, jewelry, basket work, textiles, carpets, costumes, musical instruments, etc.) More detailed definitions can be found in the <link url="http://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/tk/en/wipo_grtkf_ic_7/wipo_grtkf_ic_7_3.pdf">World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)</link> and <link url="http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=34325&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html">United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)</link> Model Provisions. TK is used interchangeably with the term <emphasis>traditional cultural expressions (TCEs)</emphasis>; both refer to music, art, designs, names, signs and symbols, performances, architectural forms, handicrafts and narratives. TCEs are integral to the cultural and social identities of indigenous and local communities. They embody knowledge and skills, and they transmit core values and beliefs.</para>

        <title>What is the Debate About?</title>
        <para id="id1165754633450">Several combined forces have recently led to commercialization of TCEs on a global scale without due respect being given to the cultural or economic interests of the communities from which they originate. The Internet provides pervasive access to TCEs. The demand of western consumers for what is sometimes (disrespectfully) called "primitive art" has increased. Finally, tourism in developing countries has exposed more potential consumers to manifestations of folklore that can be found there. As a result, indigenous groups are seeking protection for their TCEs and their responses have affected legislation at national, regional and international levels.</para>

        <title>What types of Traditional Knowledge are Most Frequently Used?</title>
        <para id="id1165746584240">Exploitation of TK occurs in different forms. Examples include the unauthorized production of indigenous craft objects in the <link url="http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/tk/en/studies/cultural/minding-culture/studies/carpetscase-main.pdf">souvenir market</link>, the unauthorized use of indigenous imagery on <link url="http://www.wipo.int/tk/en//studies/cultural/minding-culture/studies/rockart.pdf">clothing</link>, <link url="http://cita.chattanooga.org/chml.html">food products</link>, or <link url="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1627209.stm">toys</link>, the unauthorized use of indigenous names or phrases as <link url="http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/tk/en/studies/cultural/minding-culture/studies/trademarks.pdf">trademarks</link>, the unauthorized incorporation of traditional dance into commercial <link url="http://www.villagevoice.com/2004-04-13/news/rap-rage-redvolution/">performances</link>, and the unauthorized use of traditional music in commercial <link url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwanese_aborigines">musical productions</link>.</para>

        <title>What Kind of Legal Liability Governs?</title>
        <para id="id1165755597056">What kinds of legal rules (if any) should govern use of traditional knowledge by people who are not members of communities from which the TK originates? This issue is being addressed on national, regional and international levels. TK might be protected through conventional IP law -- for example, through the use of Copyright law, Patent law, Geographical Indicators, or Certification Trademarks. However, many regions and countries have found it difficult to fit TK into traditional IP protection schemes. As a result, some have adopted <emphasis effect="italics">sui generis</emphasis> laws that apply specifically to TK. Examples of these different approaches are discussed below.</para>

        <title>Countries Whose Traditional IP Laws Do Not Cover Traditional Knowledge</title>
        <para id="id1165755839448">Several nations have copyright laws that expressly exclude folklore from the list of works eligible for copyright protection. These include: <emphasis>Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Lithuania, Moldova, Russia, Slovenia, The Ukraine, Uzbekistan </emphasis>and <emphasis>Yemen</emphasis>. These countries tend to classify traditional knowledge as within the "public domain" and thus do not restrict use of or access to TK. For instance, <link url="http://www.ohr.int/ohr-dept/legal/oth-legist/doc/BH-LAW-ON-COPYRIGHT-AND-RELATED-RIGHTS.doc">Article 9</link> of the 2002 Copyright Act of <emphasis>Bosnia and Herzegovina</emphasis> states that "the use of folk literature and art creations for the purpose of a literary, artistic or scientific arrangement shall be free."</para>

        <title>Countries Whose Traditional IP Laws Cover Traditional Knowledge</title>
        <section id="id1165746614932">
          <title>Protection Despite No Explicit Reference to TCE</title>
          <para id="id1165758074012">The traditional IP statutes in some nations contain no explicit references to folklore, but TCEs may still be protected in those nations under copyright law, other traditional intellectual property doctrines, or through special statutes. For example, most countries in Europe have copyright legislation that may be used to cover traditional knowledge, but do not have any provisions explicitly mentioning TCEs. These include: <emphasis>Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark,Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland, Portugal, San Marino, Spain, Sweden,</emphasis> and <emphasis>Switzerland</emphasis>. Several other "major industrialized countries" lack explicit TCE references as well. These include: <emphasis>Australia, Canada, Japan, </emphasis>and the <emphasis>United States</emphasis>. Additionally, several countries with recently-enacted copyright legislation have not expressly included TCEs within its scope. Included in this group are several Asian countries (such as <emphasis>India, Malaysia, Philippines,</emphasis> and <emphasis>Thailand</emphasis>) and several Caribbean and South American countries (such as <emphasis>Barbados, El Salvador, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, </emphasis>and <emphasis>Venezuela</emphasis>). Silence in these statutes, however, does not mean that traditional knowledge is unprotected. Rather, in these countries TCEs are protected on the basis of traditional IP, customary, regional or international laws or through <emphasis effect="italics">sui generis</emphasis> legislation.</para>
          <para id="id1165757664869">In <emphasis>Australia</emphasis>, TCEs are protected through traditional copyright law. For example, in <link url="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AILR/1996/20.html">Milpurrurru v. Indofurn Ply Ltd.</link>, aboriginal Australian artists sued to prevent the importation by a Perth-based company of carpets manufactured in Vietnam, upon which were reproduced the designs of several prominent aboriginal artists without their permission. The designs had been copied from a portfolio of artworks produced by the Australian National Gallery. The federal court awarded the aboriginal artists substantial damages for copyright infringement and granted an injunction against any further infringement. The court pointed out that the unauthorized use of the artwork involved the pirating of cultural heritage and that such behavior could have far reaching effects on the Australian cultural environment. It was deemed especially offensive that the images had been used on a medium (carpet) that was designed to be walked upon.</para>
          <para id="id1165755605666">Other nations have begun using trademark law to protect TCEs, even when TCEs are not mentioned in national statutes. For example, in <emphasis>Canada, New Zealand </emphasis>and the <emphasis>United States</emphasis>, as well as <emphasis>Australia</emphasis>, indigenous people have sometimes relied (with varying degrees of success) upon trademark law or its equivalent to protect tribal names and other designs and motifs against unauthorized use by others. Considerable efforts have also been made to protect sacred and culturally significant symbols as well as collective and certification marks under traditional trademark law. For instance, <emphasis>Australia</emphasis><emphasis effect="bold"/>provides for design registration, which allows for the registration of features of shape, configuration, pattern or ornamentation applicable to an article. This system protects the visual form for 16 years, provided that it is new and original and is not based on a pre-existing design. Still, because of the originality requirement, this system has not yet been effective for protecting folklore. More effective is the system used in <emphasis>New Zealand</emphasis>. There, the recently adopted <link url="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2002/0049/latest/DLM164240.html?search=ts_act_Trade+Marks+Act_resel&amp;sr=1">Trade Marks Act of 2002</link>, prevents the registration of trademarks based on Maori text or imagery where the use or registration of such marks would be offensive to the Maori. The Commissioner of Trade Marks has set up a Maori Advisory Committee to advise on whether the proposed registration or use of a mark is likely to be offensive.</para>
          <para id="id1165728016843">Although the <emphasis>United States </emphasis>has not acted to provide general protection for indigenous peoples' traditional knowledge, it has sometimes adopted narrow statutes in response to Native Americans' attempts to regain self-governance and to control the use of their traditional knowledge by non-community members. Efforts of this sort include:</para>

          <title>Protection Using Explicit Reference to TCEs</title>
          <para id="id1165746763575">Many countries now explicitly refer to folklore in their copyright legislation. Such references take various forms.</para>
          <para id="id1165757851410">Some countries have sections, chapters, or special parts of copyright law that are entirely devoted to folklore. Countries within this group include <emphasis>Algeria, Bolivia, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Chile, Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Mongolia, Morocco, Namibia, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Rwanda, Seychelles, Togo, Tanzania, Tunisia,</emphasis> and <emphasis>Zimbabwe</emphasis>.</para>
          <para id="id1165758075630">In the <emphasis>Congo</emphasis>, for example, folklore is considered party of the country's heritage, and Congolese copyright law protects folklore without a time limitation. A "Body of Authors" society is responsible for collecting royalties, representing authors' interests, and overseeing the use of folklore. Permission must be sought from the society before any public performance, reproduction, or adaptation of folklore for commercial purposes. This includes the import or distribution of copies of works of national folklore made abroad. Public agencies are exempted from the obligation to obtain prior authorization to use folklore for non-profit activities, though they still must notify the society before use.</para>
          <para id="id1165755447019">In <emphasis>Ghana</emphasis>, the recently adopted <link url="http://www.wipo.int/clea/en/text_pdf.jsp?lang=EN&amp;id=1789.">Copyright Act of 2005</link> significantly changed the way traditional knowledge is protected. In the Act, copyright protection extends to literary works, artistic works, musical works, sound recordings, broadcasts, cinematographic works, choreographic works, derivative works, and program-carrying broadcast signals. To be eligible for copyright, the work must be original, in writing (or otherwise reduced to material form), and created by a citizen or resident of Ghana. The work must also have been first published in Ghana, or, if first published outside Ghana, published in Ghana within thirty days of its original publication. A work created by an individual is protected for the life of that individual plus fifty years; a work created by a corporation is protected for fifty years from the date on which the work was first made public. In Ghana, an author has exclusive rights to reproduce the work (with the exception of private use, quotations in other works, and use in pedagogy, which are permitted). It is an infringement of the copyright to reproduce, sell or exhibit in public for commercial purposes any work without authorization, or to use the work in a manner that adversely affects the reputation of the author. Both civil and criminal penalties may apply. Article 59 of the Act establishes a National Folklore Board, which governs the administration, preservation, registration and promotion of expressions of folklore. The Board may authorize the use of folklore and may determine a fee to be paid. The Act provides that the copyrights of authors of folklore vest in the government as if the government were the creator of the works. In Ghana (as in the Central African Republic and Congo), funds from fees or other money accruing from the use of folklore are to be used for social welfare benefits.</para>
          <para id="id1165746550310"><emphasis effect="bold">Namibia</emphasis> grants indigenous communities indefinite exclusive rights to control expressions of folklore and their adaptations, translations, and transformations. These exclusive rights include the right to publicize, make a reproduction, or distribute copies of an expression of folklore; communicate an expression of folklore to the public by performance, broadcasting, distribution by cable or other means; include an expression of folklore in a cinematographic film or a television broadcast; cause the folklore expression, or a television program or other program including the expression, to be transmitted in a diffusion service (unless such service transmits a lawful broadcast, including the expression, and is operated by the original broadcaster); make adaptations, translations and other transformation of the expression (<link url="http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/tk/en/consultations/questionnaires/ic-2-7/namibia.pdf">Article 60</link>). <link url="http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/tk/en/consultations/questionnaires/ic-2-7/namibia.pdf">Article 61</link>, however, allows a secondary user to use expressions of folklore for personal or private use, criticism or review, teaching or scientific research, and incidental use. Article 61 also allows the use of the original expression if the use is "compatible with fair practice," such as for creating an illustration or borrowing the expression to create an original work.</para>
          <para id="id1165757655212">Likewise, <emphasis>Nigerian</emphasis> <link url="http://www.nigeria-law.org/CopyrightAct.htm">Copyright Law</link> protects expressions of folklore "against reproduction, communication to the public by performance, broadcasting, [or] distribution by cable." In addition, it forbids adaptations, translations, and other transformations of such folklore, when made either for commercial purposes or outside their traditional customary context. The right to authorize any of these acts lies with the Nigerian Copyright Council. However, Nigerian folklore may be used without authorization for private, educational, or illustrative purposes. The law requires identification of the source of the folklore by reference to the community or place from which the folklore is derived. Violations of the law subject the user to liability in damages, injunctions, and other remedies the court deems appropriate. Nigeria also protects traditional knowledge through patents and trademarks. To be patentable, an invention must be new, result from inventive activity, and be capable of industrial application. The patent right is vested in the inventor, and the patent is valid for 20 years after the filing date. Additionally, Nigerian legislation protects registered trademarks. Registration is valid for seven years and then can be renewed; registration is limited to marks that are distinctive.</para>

In addition, it extends protection to a "work of folklore," which it defines as a literary, musical or artistic work, whether or not it is recorded, of which: (a) no person can claim to be the author; and (b) the form or content is embodied in the traditions peculiar to one or more communities in Zimbabwe; and includes: (i) folk tales, folk poetry and traditional riddles; (ii) folk songs and instrumental folk music; (iii) folk dances, plays and artistic forms of ritual; and (iv) productions of folk art, in particular drawings, paintings, sculptures, pottery, woodwork, metalwork, jewelery, baskets and costumes (<link url="http://www.unesco.org/culture/pdf/anti-piracy/Zimbabwe/zb_copyright_2000_en">Section 80</link>).</para>
          <para id="id1165757877556">The copyright laws in several other countries shield traditional knowledge by including folklore in the list of literary and artistic works eligible for regular copyright protection.

          <para id="id1165755583089"><emphasis>Senegal</emphasis> includes folklore in the list of works eligible for copyright protection. Article 1 of the Senegalese Copyright Act provides special protection for folklore, and Article 9 states that any "direct or indirect" fixation of such material for "profit-making purposes" is subject to prior authorization by the Copyright Office of Senegal. All folklore uses require prior authorization from the Office, which charges users a fee whose amount depends on the nature of the use and prior arrangements.

        <title>Annex VII in the 1977 Bangui Agreement</title>
        <para id="id1165755584197">The most notable difference between the 1977 and the 1999 Agreements is the removal of direct protection of folklore from the copyright section. Annex VII of the 1977 Agreement obliged member states to declare use of folklore to a national agency and to pay fees for such use. The fees collected were directed, in part, to cultural and social purposes. This section was criticized for its vagueness because most people were not sure how broadly to interpret the scope of “use of elements borrowed from folklore” (1977 Agreement, Annex VII, Chapter 1, Article 8, para. 5). Additionally, the older version of the Bangui Agreement imposed a fine for any use “of folklore work or a work that has entered the public domain” without prior declaration to the appropriate national agency (1977 Agreement, Annex VII, Chapter 1, Article 38, para. 2). The older system can be described as one in which folklore automatically belongs to the public domain and folklore users simply pay the public domain for the use to be authorized. Alternatively, this older system can be characterized as one in which folklore is owned and regulated by the state because, as declared in the original Agreement, the state has an indefeasible right with respect to folklore and “folklore is by its origin part of national heritage” (1977 Agreement, Annex VII, Chapter 1, Article 8, para. 1). The tension between these two interpretations ultimately created confusion regarding who owned TCEs. Protection of folklore and cultural heritage was then moved from the copyright section of the 1977 Agreement to the section discussing provisions common to copyright and neighboring rights in the 1999 Agreement. As discussed below, this new placement did not eliminate confusion and ambiguity.</para>

        <para id="id1165755397657">The 1999 Bangui Agreement continues earlier attempts to protect folklore and cultural heritage. Under the new system, users of folklore must receive prior authorization. The objectives of the system are to protect (Chapter 2), to safeguard (Chapter 3), and to promote (Chapter 4) cultural heritage. “Cultural heritage” is defined as a composition of “all those material or immaterial human productions that are characteristic of a nation over time and space. Such productions relate to (i) folklore, (ii) sites and monuments; [and] (iii) ensembles” (Article 67, paras. 1-2). The definitions of “folklore” (Article 68) and “monuments” (Article 70) are very detailed. Additionally, the definitions of “sites” and “ensembles” can be found in Articles 69 and 71, respectively.</para>
        <para id="id1165755412510">Prohibited acts are listed in Article 73. They include deformation, export, misappropriation, and unlawful transfer. Article 74 states three main exceptions to these prohibitions: "use for teaching," "use as illustration of the original work of an author on condition that the scope of such use remains compatible with honest practice," and "borrowings for the creation of an original work from one or more authors."</para>
        <para id="id1165762552295">A fee payment scheme similar to the 1977 Agreement still exists in which “the exploitations of expressions of folklore and that of works or productions that have fallen into the public domain . . . shall be subject to the user entering into an undertaking to pay the national collective rights administration body a relevant royalty” (1999 Agreement, Annex VII, Chapter 5, Article 59, para. 1). The fees will be donated, in part, to “welfare and cultural purposes” (1999 Agreement, Annex VII, Chapter 5, Article 59, para. 3).</para>
        <para id="id1165757618052">Some observers contend that the 1999 Agreement completely removed folklore from copyright law and instead provided it with <emphasis effect="italics">sui generis</emphasis> protection whereby folklore is regulated and owned by the government. However, others see that folklore can still be protected as a form of copyright as stated in Article 5 of Annex VII. This ambiguity creates confusion as to who owns folklore under the terms of the Agreement. This confusion is even greater than in the 1977 Agreement because there are no longer specific references to the States having an indefeasible right with respect to folklore and cultural heritage.</para>

In 1995, the regional organization adopted an important protocol to protect indigenous heritage: the Protocol for the Harmonization of Intellectual Property Norms in MERCOSUR with respect to Trademarks and Indications of Source or Denominations of Origin. In particular, Article 19 of the Protocol requires Party States to “reciprocally protect their indications of source and dominations of origin.” “Denomination of origin” is defined broadly as “the geographical name of a country, city, region or locality within a Party State's territory, which designates products or services whose qualities or characteristics are exclusively or essentially caused by the geographical environment, including natural and human factors.” Such a broad definition of geographic origin -- which notably includes “human factors” -- encompasses traditional cultural expressions. Similarly, the Protocol attempts to protect traditional knowledge through its definition of “indications of source” by basing the defined term on the location that is “known as a center place for extraction, production or manufacture of a certain product or for the performance of a certain service.” In 1996, MERCOSUR affirmed the importance of cultural rights by creating the Protocol on the Cultural Integration of MERCOSUR.

The laws are noteworthy because they not only protect TK and TCEs but also employ customary uses as the foundation of the framework.</para>
        <para id="id1165728120150">The Framework’s general approach is to create <emphasis effect="italics">new</emphasis> rights in traditional knowledge and expressions of culture, which previously may have been regarded as part of the public domain. People seeking to use TCEs must have prior and informed consent from the traditional owners. The rights the Framework specifies fall into two categories: moral rights and traditional cultural rights. It is crucial to note that neither moral nor traditional cultural rights depend on copyright formalities (e.g., registration requirements). Moral rights include the right of attribution, the right against false attribution, and the right of integrity of indigenous work. As stated in Clause 7(2) of Part I, traditional cultural rights include the right to reproduce, publish, perform, make available online, and create derivative works, among many others. These are said to be both exclusive and inalienable.</para>
        <para id="id1165746842116">Clause 11 is noteworthy because it states that traditional rights exist in addition to (and do not affect) the rights created by other intellectual property law regimes. Clause 7(4) provides that there is no traditional knowledge protection in the following contexts: face-to-face teaching, criticism or review, reporting news or current events, judicial proceedings, and incidental use.</para>
        <para id="id1165746842120">Clause 7 of Part I of the Framework makes clear who owns the protected TCEs. Traditional owners are defined as: “a group, clan, or community of people, or the individual who is recognized by a group, clan, or community of people as the individual, in whom the custody or protection of the traditional knowledge or expressions of culture are entrusted in accordance with customary law and the practices of that group, clan, or community.”</para>
        <para id="id1165746849306">Finally, Clause 37 details the role of the Cultural Authority in protecting TCEs. Those attempting to seek permission to use elements of protected TCEs have two options: (1) apply directly to the Cultural Authority or (2) communicate directly with the traditional owners. One of the Authority’s many roles is to advise the traditional owners. Valid TCE users must prove they have received consent from the traditional owners via an “authorized user agreement.”</para>
        <para id="id1165754453521">This Framework is ambitious and may provide for strong TCE protection once adopted; however, its potential impact is unknown as the laws have not yet been implemented.</para>

        <title>WIPO Draft Provisions on Traditional Cultural Expressions/Folklore and Traditional Knowledge (2006)</title>
        <para id="id1165734511085">In 1998, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) embarked on a fact-finding mission to 28 countries to identify intellectual property-related regulations of traditional knowledge. Following a review of those materials, the WIPO Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore (the IGC) was formed in 2001. Since 2004, it has been <link url="http://www.wipo.int/tk/en/consultations/draft_provisions/draft_provisions.html">working</link> on draft provisions for the enhanced protection of traditional cultural expressions against misappropriation and misuse. Although the provisions are still in draft form, they are meant to serve as points of reference for ongoing policy discussions at the national, regional, and international levels.</para>
        <para id="id1165734511117">The Draft Provisions have the following objectives: to recognize value; to promote respect; to meet the actual needs of communities; to prevent the misappropriation of traditional cultural expressions/expressions of folklore; to empower communities; to support customary practices and community cooperation; to contribute to safeguarding traditional cultures; to encourage community innovation and creativity; to promote intellectual and artistic freedom, research and cultural exchange on equitable terms; to contribute to cultural diversity; to promote community development and legitimate trading activities; to preclude unauthorized IP rights and to enhance certainty, transparency and mutual confidence.

        <title>Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions (2005)</title>
        <para id="id1165757864563">The Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions builds off the earlier <link url="http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13179&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html">Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity</link> of (2001). <emphasis>Canada, France, Germany, Greece, Mexico, Monaco, Morocco,</emphasis> and <emphasis>Senegal</emphasis> and Francophone member states of UNESCO strongly supported the Convention. The <emphasis>United States</emphasis> opposed it. 104 countries have acceded to or ratified the Convention.</para>
        <para id="id1165733248556">The Convention recognizes "the importance of traditional knowledge as a source of intangible and material wealth, and in particular the knowledge systems of indigenous peoples, and its positive contribution to sustainable development, as well as the need for its adequate protection and promotion." It seeks to “to reaffirm the sovereign rights of States to maintain, adopt and implement policies and measures that they deem appropriate for the protection and promotion of the diversity of cultural expressions on their territory” (Article 1(h)). The Convention also seeks to mitigate the dilution of culture that follows from the movement of cultural goods and services across national borders.</para>
        <para id="id1165746852639">The Convention mentions intellectual property rights once, by recognizing "the importance of intellectual property rights in sustaining those involved in cultural creativity." The Convention is ambiguous, however, on how much protection to grant to TCEs. Article 6 lists the types of measures member states may adopt to protect and promote cultural diversity. Subsection 2(g) allows “measures aimed at nurturing and supporting artists and others involved in the creation of cultural expressions” but subsection 2(e) allows for measure that “promote the free exchange and circulation of . . . cultural expressions and cultural activities, goods and services.” Strong support for indigenous groups as creators of TCEs is not required by Article 7, as members states need only “endeavour to recognize the important contribution of artists, others involved in the creative process, cultural communities, and organizations that support their work, and their central role in nurturing the diversity of cultural expressions.” Professor Laurence R. Helfer has <link url="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=891303">noted</link> that the Convention disregards the protection for TCEs that could be derived from the use of intellectual property law.</para>

The Resolution notes that “actual or potential conflicts exist between the implementation of the TRIPS Agreement and the realization of economic, social and cultural rights in relation to . . . the reduction of communities’ (especially indigenous communities’) control over their own . . . natural resources and cultural values.” It declares that “the implementation of the TRIPS Agreement does not adequately reflect the fundamental nature and indivisibility of all human rights, including . . . the right to self-determination. There are apparent conflicts between the intellectual property rights regime embodied in the TRIPS Agreement, on the one hand, and international human rights law, on the other.” The Sub-Commission urged national governments, intergovernmental organizations, and civil society groups to give human rights primacy over the economic policies and agreements.

      <title>Policy Arguments</title>
      <para id="id1165733504950">As indicated above, the questions of whether and how to protect traditional knowledge are currently being debated and are highly controversial. At the international level and within many individual countries, strong differences of opinion can be found. Set forth below are summaries of the primary arguments made in this debate.</para>
      <section id="id1165746876275">
        <title>Why Protect TK?</title>
        <para id="id1165746457575"><emphasis>Arguments from Personhood.</emphasis> For many indigenous groups, TK encompasses cultural elements that are integral to the group's sense of identity. One can argue that objects and expressions that are fundamental to a person's or group's identity merit protection, and at the extreme, could be considered inalienable. Similarly, some advocates for TK protection have proposed a "cultural stewardship" justification for this protection. For example, Kristen Carpenter, Sonya Katyal and Angela Riley advocate allowing indigenous communities to retain control, if not exclusive access and ownership, of TK because of its importance in shaping the identity of the indigenous group and its culture.</para>
        <para id="id1165734511456">Closely related to arguments from personhood are arguments from moral rights, which we discussed in Module 4. It is argued, just as an individual artist should enjoy a right of attribution and integrity with respect to her creations, so should a community enjoy a right of attribution and integrity with respect to its collective creations.</para>
        <para id="id1165734511460"><emphasis>Arguments based on Preservation.</emphasis> Another reason to advocate for protection of TK is that unlike many forms of intellectual property, cultural expressions may require protection in order to preserve their value. For example, religious ceremonies and sacred rituals may be valuable to a culture in part because they are not widespread; their rarity is integral to their place in the culture. In order to maintain the value of these traditions, it may be necessary to restrict their use.</para>
        <para id="id1165734511476"><emphasis>Arguments based on Reparations.</emphasis> A third argument in favor of protection for TK is based upon the idea that many indigenous cultures have been damaged by invasive colonialism practiced by Western countries in the past few centuries. Supporters of this argument believe that protection of TK is a way of providing reparations, symbolic as well as monetary, for the wrongs committed against these indigenous groups.</para>

            <title>Copyright</title>
            <para id="id1165734511535">As we have seen, many nations have used copyright law (either alone or in conjunction with <emphasis effect="italics">sui generis</emphasis> laws) to protect TK. However, there are many arguments against using standard copyright to protect TK.</para>
            <list id="id1165758121674" list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic">
              <item><emphasis effect="italics">The fixation requirement.</emphasis> Some copyright systems require that a work be fixed in a material form. This is an obstacle in the protection of TCEs, which are not always manifested in tangible expressions.</item>
              <item><emphasis effect="italics">Originality.</emphasis> Copyright law requires that a work be "original" in order to merit protection. Since most TK is "traditional" rather than new, this originality requirement will often be difficult to satisfy.</item>
              <item><emphasis effect="italics">Authorship.</emphasis> Much cultural expression develops gradually over time, through the contributions of several members of a community. If no single author or group of authors can be identified, it will be difficult for copyright protection to be obtained.</item>
              <item><emphasis effect="italics">The term of protection.</emphasis> The term of protection for copyright in most countries is traditionally limited, and not infinite. Many forms of TK are in fact older than the copyright term. As a result, copyright protection may be unavailable for them.</item>
            </list>
            <para id="id1165746862814">To avoid these difficulties, it is possible for countries to modify copyright legislation so that it has different requirements for folklore or cultural expression. For example, the <link url="http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=31318&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html">Tunis Model Law for Copyright in the Developing Countries</link>, adopted in 1976, advocates extending copyright protection to works of folklore without requiring fixation and with an unlimited term of protection.</para>

            <title>Trademark Law</title>
            <para id="id1165746875061">Some expressions of folklore might be registered as trademarks. Trademark law protects not only graphic representations, but also words and (in some countries) sounds. An advantage of protection through trademark law is its near indefinite term of protection, and its lack of a novelty requirement; it is sufficient for purposes of protection that the trademark has a "distinctive character." However, at least in some countries, trademark protection, unlike copyright and patent protection, requires that the applicant demonstrate use of the mark in commerce. Many cultural expressions do not have a direct link to commerce and are not used as designations of source to the consuming public. Furthermore, the application of trademark law to TK is complicated, since by registering a mark the community makes public TK that the community may desire to keep secret for religious or other reasons.</para>

            <title>Collective Trademarks, Certification Marks, and Geographic Indicators</title>
            <para id="id1165729348607">Collective trademarks, certification marks, and geographic indicators form a subset of trademark law that could be particularly useful for the protection of TK. Collective trademarks are trademarks that are used by a group of producers rather than one producer. Collective marks are held by an association rather than an individual; in order to be useful for protecting TK, members of indigenous groups would need to form an association for the purpose of marking their cultural expressions.</para>
            <para id="id1165729348615">Certification marks indicate that the producer of a good has met certain standards of quality. (A popular example is the <link url="http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/product-testing/history/welcome-gh-seal">Good Housekeeping</link> certification prominent on household products sold in the United States.) Certification marks could be used to specify which TCEs meet the standards of the indigenous community in which they originated. This, like a collective trademark, would require the formation an official oversight organization to act on behalf of the indigenous community in determining which expressions can bear the certification mark.</para>
            <para id="id1165729348642">Geographic indicators, as the name suggests, are marks that can be placed on products that come from a specific geographic area. Geographic indicators are often used for food products, such as wines, but some indigenous groups have experimented with using geographic indicators as a means of protecting cultural expressions by authenticating products that are sold elsewhere. One example of such a program is the Alaskan <link url="http://www.eed.state.ak.us/aksca/Native.htm">Silver Hand Program</link>.</para>

[T]he rights of the creator are not absolute but conditional on contributing to the common good and welfare of society.... [B]ecause a human rights approach also establishes a different and often more exacting standard for evaluating the appropriateness of granting intellectual property protection, in order for intellectual property to fulfill the conditions necessary to be recognised as a universal human right, intellectual property regimes and the manner they are implemented first and foremost must be consistent with the realisation of the other human rights, particularly those enumerated in the Covenant."</para>

        <title>Why not protect TK?</title>
        <para id="id1165729348882">Some observers think that legal protection for traditional knowledge is highly problematic. Here are some of their arguments:</para>
        <para id="id1165729348888"><emphasis>TK does not map onto IP law easily</emphasis>. As indicated above, traditional cultural expressions are often not put into a fixed form, are not "original," and do not have a defined author -- three requirements for copyright protection. Furthermore, as indicated above, most expressions of folklore are not used in commerce as a means of identifying their source, and so would not be eligible for trademark protection. Finally, patent law may not be available to protect TK because by definition, TK has been used and passed down through generations, and this type of prior public use may preclude patent protection, as least if it is publicly recorded. Thus, it appears that certain attributes of TK make it a difficult fit with all three of the major types of intellectual property law. Additionally, protection for TK does not fit well with the principal goals underlying the protection of intellectual property law. There is little evidence that protection of TK is necessary to incentivize the creation of cultural expression, as other factors have successfully motivated the creation of these expressions for millennia. Furthermore, the labor-desert theory does not easily fit with TK protection, as those who created the traditional expression are either unidentifiable because the expression was the product of collaboration, or in some cases, long dead. Current members of the culture do not have as strong a claim for protection from a labor-desert perspective.</para>
        <para id="id1165757685089"><emphasis>Protection of TK would involve perpetuation of illiberal social hierarchies and oppressive customs within indigenous groups.</emphasis> Another argument against providing protection for TK is that doing so may perpetuate inequality and oppression within indigenous groups. When an indigenous group is given the right to control the use of TK, the powerful members of that indigenous group may benefit at the expense of the group's minorities. Paul Kuruk argues that protection of TK may further the oppression of women and subordinated social and economic groups within an indigenous culture.</para>
        <para id="id1165729348909"><emphasis>Protection of TK may deprive the world community of valuable knowledge.</emphasis> Some might argue that principles of liberal democracy dictate that knowledge should be freely shared rather than restricted to certain people or groups. Protection of TK might deprive outsiders of a chance to benefit from the traditions, medicinal or otherwise, of an indigenous culture. When advancing this argument, however, one should keep in mind that principles of liberal democracy, while widely accepted in the Western world, are not necessarily an agreed-upon starting point for this debate.</para>
        <para id="id1165729348922"><emphasis>Increase awareness rather than changing the law.</emphasis> Some organizations have advocated protection of TK through nongovernmental organizations and projects rather than through legislation. For example, the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage has compiled a <link url="http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00011#list">List of Intangible Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding</link>. UNESCO lists projects for safeguarding intangible cultural heritage in African countries <link url="http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00176">here</link>. Finally, groups of academics and activists have created community standards for those, such as anthropologists, whose work impacts indigenous cultures and may involve sensitive issues of disclosure of TK.</para>

      <para id="id1165729348985">Nadia should make Angela aware of the various types of national intellectual property laws that could apply to this situation. For example, in their country traditional dances might be protected under copyright or <emphasis effect="italics">sui generis</emphasis> statutes. However, those laws would only apply within their country, not to the distribution of the Madonna video in other countries. Nadia should also make Angela aware of regional organizations of which their country may be a member. Finally, Nadia could help equip Angela to advocate for protection of her community's traditional cultural expressions by making her aware of the policy recommendations and reports of international organizations, such as WIPO, and the relevant committees that may be proposing draft legislation on traditional knowledge in the near future</para>
